# Smart-Barrier

A toll gate automation system powered by an ultrasonic sensor and servo motor. When a vehicle comes within range, the system deactivates the blue LED and activates the red LED, signaling the toll gate to open. The buzzer provides an audible alert while the servo motor lifts the barrier for 1.5 seconds.
